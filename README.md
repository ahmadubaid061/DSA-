# DSA Spring 2025
# Overview
This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms studied during the Spring 2025 semester (January - June). All code is written in C++ and is intended for educational purposes, demonstrating fundamental DSA concepts.

# Data Structures Included
- Arrays: Basic array operations and applications.
- Linked Lists: Singly and doubly linked lists with common operations.
- Stacks: Implementation using arrays and linked lists.
- Queues: Standard queues, circular queues, and priority queues.
- Hash Tables: Basic hashing with collision resolution techniques.
- Trees: Binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees.
- Graphs: Adjacency list/matrix representations and algorithms like DFS and BFS.

# Algorithms Covered
- Sorting: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick.
- Searching: Linear and Binary search.
- Graph Algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- Others: Various operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal for each data structure.

# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
- Basic understanding of C++ programming and DSA concepts.
# How to Use
- Clone the repository:
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Spring-2025.git
- Navigate to the desired data structure folder.
- Compile and run the C++ files using a compiler:
- g++ filename.cpp -o output./output

# Contribution
This is a personal project for learning purposes. Feel free to fork the repository and adapt the code for your own studies. Suggestions or improvements can be submitted via issues or pull requests.
